# Noise Functions for Procedural Terrain Generation
Here I have a python notebook that I have been using for testing Perlin noise and its possibilities for creating some interesting generated terrain. There is also a single python file where I implemented value noise, 
although I was having trouble finding a fast method of interpolation that looked good (bicubic interpolation was too slow but did look great), so I haven't worked on it more than just the base implementation.
